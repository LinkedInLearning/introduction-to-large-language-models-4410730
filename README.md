## Course Description

Large language models (LLMs) have taken the AI world by storm. LLMs are behind some of the biggest AI technologies over the last few years, like ChatGPT and GPT-4. In this course, Jonathan Fernandes provides an overview of LLMs suitable for technical learners and non-technical learners alike. Jonathan shows you what LLMs are and what you can do with them, and takes a look under the hood so you can understand why they work the way they do and how they can affect your work. He explains how LLMs are trained and details the components of LLMs, and then takes a look at several different applications of LLMs—including Google’s BERT, GPT-3, PaLM and PaLM 2, ChatGPT and GPT-4, and Llama—and shows you how to compare LLMs using benchmarks.
